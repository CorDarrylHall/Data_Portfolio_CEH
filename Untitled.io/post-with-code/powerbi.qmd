## Offer Analysis Summary

This Power BI Summary is a real-life example that I created for a previous organization. This dashboard was designed to provide an overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that were relevant to the organization's goals and objectives.

### **Offer Accept Ratio:**

**Summary:** This metric measures the acceptance rate of job offers among different specialized groups, calculated monthly.

**Key Insights:** Higher acceptance rates indicate successful alignment between job offers and candidate expectations.

Lower acceptance rates suggest potential areas needing improvement in the recruitment process.

### **Offer Decline Ratio:**

**Summary:** This metric tracks the rate at which job offers are declined among different specialized groups, calculated monthly.

**Key Insights:** Helps identify why certain groups decline offers more frequently, such as mismatches between job requirements and candidate skills or issues with compensation packages.

Provides data for proactive adjustments in recruitment strategies.

### **Salary Competitiveness:**

**Summary:** This metric measures how competitive the organization's job offers are compared to the market, based on pay grade and job description/category.

**Key Insights:** A low score indicates the need for salary adjustments to attract top talent.

A high score suggests that the organization's offers are competitive, aiding in talent attraction and retention.

## **Conclusion**

### **Key Takeaways:**

The **Offer Accept Ratio** and **Offer Decline Ratio** metrics offer crucial insights into the recruitment process, highlighting the effectiveness of job offers and areas for improvement.

**Salary Competitiveness** is essential for understanding the organization's position in the job market, ensuring competitive compensation packages.

The interactive dashboard design allows for in-depth analysis and informed decision-making across various organizational facets.

Continuous monitoring of these metrics enables the organization to adapt strategies, enhance performance, improve recruitment efforts, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.
