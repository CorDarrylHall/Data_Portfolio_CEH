This dataset, collected over two years from January 2017 to June 2019, captures the behavior of Netflix users in the UK who opted to have their browser activity tracked. This data, which represents approximately 25% of global traffic activity from laptops and desktops, provides valuable insights into viewing patterns and preferences. The primary goal of this analysis is to understand how filmmakers and creators can determine what movies to produce and which audiences to target.

## Data Preparation

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(fitdistrplus)

thePath="/Users/Shared/Survival Analysis"

df = read_csv(paste(thePath, "vodclickstream_uk_movies_03.csv", sep="/"))
df2 = read_csv(paste(thePath, "netflix_titles.csv", sep="/"))

# Merging data that contains movie length to normalize watch length
df <- merge(df, df2, by = "title")

# Data cleaning and preparation
df <- subset(df, !grepl("Seasons", duration.y)) # Removing seasons
df$duration.y <- as.numeric(gsub(" min", "", df$duration.y)) # Converting duration to numeric
df <- subset(df, duration.x > 0) # Removing invalid durations

# Creating columns for analysis
df <- df %>%
    mutate(
        event = ifelse(duration.x > 0, 1, 0),
        genres = as.factor(genres),
        minutes_watched = duration.x / 60,
        perc_movie_watched = minutes_watched / duration.y,
        is_action = ifelse(grepl('Action', genres), 1, 0),
        is_adventure = ifelse(grepl('Adventure', genres), 1, 0),

        is_romance = ifelse(grepl('romance', genres), 1, 0),
        is_animation = ifelse(grepl('animation', genres), 1, 0),
        is_crime = ifelse(grepl('Crime', genres), 1, 0),

    )

# Cleaning up the percentage of the movie watched

## Key Insights and Analysis

To understand viewing patterns across different genres, survival analysis was employed. The survival curves represent the probability of users continuing to watch a movie over time, segmented by genre. Here are the insights and analyses for some key genres:

### **Action Movies:**

```{r}
survobj <- Surv(df$perc_movie_watched_clean, df$event)
fit_action <- survfit(survobj~is_action, data = df)
ggsurvplot(fit=fit_action, data=df, risk.table = F, conf.int=T) +
    labs(
        title="Netflix Movie Genre Survival Curve - Action",
        x="Watch Length (Minutes)") 
surv_median(fit_action)
```

**Insight:** Action movies tend to have high initial engagement but may see a drop-off in viewership as the movie progresses.

**Analysis:** Filmmakers should focus on maintaining high-paced, engaging content throughout the movie to retain viewers.

### **Horror Movies:**

```{r}
fit_horror <- survfit(survobj~is_horror, data = df)
ggsurvplot(fit=fit_horror, data=df, risk.table = F, conf.int=T, surv.median.line = 'hv') +
    labs(
        title="Netflix Movie Genre Survival Curve - Horror",
        x="Watch Length (Minutes)") 
surv_median(fit_horror)
```

**Insight:** Horror movies have a consistent viewership curve, indicating a dedicated audience.

**Analysis:** This genre benefits from strong, suspenseful storytelling that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.

### **Thriller Movies:**

```{r}
fit_thriller <- survfit(survobj~is_thriller, data = df)
ggsurvplot(fit=fit_thriller, data=df, risk.table = F, conf.int=T, surv.median.line = 'hv') +
    labs(
        title="Netflix Movie Genre Survival Curve - Thriller",
        x="Watch Length (Minutes)") 
surv_median(fit_thriller)
```

**Insight:** Thriller movies show a steady decline in viewership over time.

**Analysis:** Thrillers need to maintain suspense and plot twists to keep the audience engaged.

### **Romance Movies:**

```{r}
fit_romance <- survfit(survobj~is_romance, data = df)
ggsurvplot(fit=fit_romance, data=df, risk.table = F, conf.int=T, surv.median.line = 'hv') +
    labs(
        title="Netflix Movie Genre Survival Curve - Romance",
        x="Watch Length (Minutes)") 
surv_median(fit_romance)
```

**Insight:** Romance movies tend to retain a significant portion of their audience throughout the film.

**Analysis:** Emotional engagement and character development are key to keeping viewers invested.

### **Animation Movies:**

```{r}
fit_animation <- survfit(survobj~is_animation, data = df)
ggsurvplot(fit=fit_animation, data=df, risk.table = F, conf.int=T, surv.median.line = 'hv') +
    labs(
        title="Netflix Movie Genre Survival Curve - Animation",
        x="Watch Length (Minutes)") 
surv_median(fit_animation)
```

**Insight:** Animation movies have high retention rates, particularly among younger audiences.

**Analysis:** Visual appeal and engaging storylines are crucial for maintaining viewer interest in animation.

## Summary
