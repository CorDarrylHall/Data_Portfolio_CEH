## Data Analysis

### **Student Performance by Ethnicity/Student Group:**

**Summary:** This analysis tracks the performance of Math students based on various demographic factors such as ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status.

**Key Insights:**

**Identification of High and Low Performing Regions:** By analyzing performance data, regions with significant disparities can be identified, enabling targeted interventions and resource allocation.

**Support for Demographic Groups:** The analysis highlights which demographic groups may require additional support or resources, informing the development of tailored educational programs.

**Regional Disparities:** The identification of regional disparities can guide policy-makers to implement targeted interventions aimed at improving educational outcomes in underperforming areas.

ORmath = read_csv(paste(thePath, "ORmath.csv", sep = "/"))
